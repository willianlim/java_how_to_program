/*
 * 7.10 (Sales Commissions) Use a one-dimensional array to solve the
 * following problem: A company pays its salespeople on a commission
 * basis. The salespeople receive $200 per week plus 9% of their gross sales
 * for that week. For example, a salesperson who grosses $5,000 in sales in a
 * week receives $200 plus 9% of $5,000, or a total of $650. Write an
 * application (using an array of counters) that determines how many of the
 * salespeople earned salaries in each of the following ranges (assume that
 * each salesperson's salary is truncated to an integer amount):
 *
 *      1. $200-299
 *      2. $300-399
 *      3. $400-499
 *      .
